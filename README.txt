This repository houses a few code examples from myself. I attempted to include code examples from a multitude of different languages but I am sure that I am forgetting some. Feel free to reach out to me (brysonmineart@arizona.edu) if you are interested in viewing more examples of my work or a more thorough explanation of the projects included.

GameOfLife23:
  - Language: C++
  - Contents: This file folder contains code in C++ that is used to show my knowledge of C++ as well as Catch2 (Testing framework).

fullStackWebsite:
  - Language(s): php, html, javascript
  - Contents: This file folder houses a "rough" fullstack website that utilizes an apache server to host itself on. The information
  is represented in a MYSQL database and is accessed through via php and javascript. While the actual visuals of the page are, in short,
  lackluster. The program housed in this file should give a good idea of my experience with a multitude of website developing languages.

Graph.java:
  - Language: java
  - Contents: This java class, not necessarily finished, shows my understanding of traversing graphs.

Translate.java:
  - Language: java
  - Contents: This program was used to parse a grammar (written by myself) utilizing regular expressions. The code itself parses and then "translates" the
  code that is inputted into java to then be ran. While the use of this program is rather trivial. It houses a good example of my knowledge in java and understanding
  of computer science concepts.

school_SQL.py:
  - Language: Python
  - Contents: This file houses a program that utilizes a database of students, classes, etc.

zstr.c:
  - Language: C
  - Contents: This program is used to almost mimic a string within C. The code will show dynamic space allocation, pointers, and more.

To finish the code examples off, I worked at the Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center as a website manager which has given me ample amounts of experience with Drupal, scripting, communications, organization, and much more. In the last year we went through a website transition, I lead this transition as we conducted content audits, redesign, and more. View the website at this link: https://www.swcasc.arizona.edu/
